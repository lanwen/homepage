#### Connect the example project with the GraphQL server ðŸ›°

You now have to tell Relay which GraphQL backend it should connect to. That is where we have to use the endpoint we generated in the previous step.

Open `./src/app.js` and provide the endpoint as an argument to the call where the `Relay.DefaultNetworkLayer` is being created:

```js
Relay.injectNetworkLayer(
  new Relay.DefaultNetworkLayer('__RELAY_API_ENDPOINT__')
);
```

Since Relay verifies your GraphQL queries and mutations at build-time, we also need to add the endpoint to the `package.json` like so:

```
"graphql": {
  "request": {
    "url": "__RELAY_API_ENDPOINT__"
  }
},
```

You can read more about why that's necessary [here](https://github.com/graphcool/babel-plugin-react-relay).

Awesome, Relay is now prepared to talk to the GraphQL server that you created in the step 1!
