          <h3>Parse just shut down. Why should I bet on you?</h3>
          <p>
            Good question! Besides the fact that Parse was shut down by Facebook because of&nbsp;
            <a href='http://nyti.ms/1OSPxj1'>strategical reasons</a>,
            we're embracing an open standard: GraphQL.<br />
            That means even in the very unlikely case of a shutdown you can still use exactly the same system.
            (Which is <a href='https://github.com/graphcool'>open source</a> by the way.)
            So don't worry about vendor lockin.

          <h3>How can I implement my server-side business logic?</h3>
          <p>
            We provide a powerful webhook system which lets you implement your custom business logic in a flexible way.
            You can choose any language/technology you want. <br />

          <h3>How does user authentication work?</h3>
          <p>
            You can choose from a range of different authentication providers such as Auth0, Facebook and Twitter.
            Alternatively we provide a simple JWT based authentication system you can extend yourself.&nbsp;
