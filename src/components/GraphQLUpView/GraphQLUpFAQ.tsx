    question: 'What use cases does graphql-up cover?',
    answer: (<span>graphql-up is ideal for anyone who wants to have a head-start with
    GraphQL without the hazzle of having to do any work on the server. You
    can use it to quickly spin up a GraphQL backend for mocking data, testing or simply
    experimenting and playing around with GraphQL.
    It's also perfect for usage in tutorials, sample projects or documentation.</span>),
  },
  {
    question: 'What does the generated GraphQL API look like?',
    answer: (<span>graphql-up generates two different APIs. The first one is
    called <a href='https://www.graph.cool/docs/reference/simple-api/overview-heshoov3ai'>Simple API</a> and
    follows best practices of the Graphcool platform.
    It can be used with any GraphQL client, such as Apollo or Lokka.
    The second is
    a <a href='https://www.graph.cool/docs/reference/relay-api/overview-aizoong9ah/'>Relay API</a> for
    dedicated use of Relay in the client.</span>),
  },

const rightFAQItems: [FAQItem] = [
  {
    question: 'How long can I use the GraphQL API that I created with graphql-up?',
    answer: (<span>Since projects created with graphql-up are not intended for
    production use, they will be deleted after 30 days of inactivity.
    If you're looking to build something more
    sustainable, consider creating a project with Graphcool.</span>),
  },
  {
    question: 'Do I have to create a Graphcool account in order to use graphql-up?',
    answer: (<span>No, graphql-up is available for absolutely everyone interested in GraphQL.
    You don't have to create an account or leave your email address. 
    Of course, it's also completely free of charge.</span>),
